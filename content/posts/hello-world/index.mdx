Hello world! Wanted to create a post briefly explaining how I used Gatsby to create this site and Netlify to deploy it. Though you can easily get started with Gatsby‚Äôs documentation [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/), I felt summarizing the primary steps would be helpful. The contents of this tutorial applies to Mac users.

### Gatsby

Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on react that can be used to build great static sites and web apps. To get started, there are various dependencies that must be installed. However, first ensure you have Homebrew installed, as it will accelerate this process. To install Homebrew, visit their [homepage](https://brew.sh) and there you will find the script you need to run on terminal. With Homebrew installed, we can proceed to install the following tools:

Install Xcode command line tools:

```noLineNumbers
xcode-select --install
```

Install Node using Homebrew:

```noLineNumbers
brew install node
```

Install git:

```noLineNumbers
brew install git
```

Install Gatsby CLI package:

```noLineNumbers
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```
Gatsby's CLI will allow us to quickly create Gatsby powered sites and access the various commands used for developing Gatsby sites.

With your environment ready now, you can start creating a Gatsby site. If you are looking for a quick way to get your site up and running, you can utilize ‚ÄúStarter sites." Which is simply partially built sites with default configuration. Fortunately, Gatsby provides a library full of [starter sites](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/) that look great and will ultimately shorten the development process. For this example, we will use Gatsby‚Äôs stater blog site. 

Which can be created using the following command:

```noLineNumbers
gatsby new my-gatsby-project https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog
```

If not installed already, you will need a text editor to edit your project. Visual studio code works great, you can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). With VS Code now installed, we can open the project and run a development server!

To run a development server, open your terminal and ensure it's pointed to the project's path. Here you will want to run the command:

Run local development server:
```noLineNumbers
gatsby develop
```

This will create a local development environment, where you can view changes to your website in real time. A local port will be created, which you can acesss through any browser installed.

All that is left is to alter any frontend code to your liking. Obviously though there are much more things you can do with Gatsby‚Äôs software, which you can research in their [documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/). However, the starter site should now be ready for modification. 

### Netlify

Netlify is an open source CMS that will allow us to host our Gatsby website for free.

To setup netlify you will need to visit their [website](https://www.netlify.com), create an account, and simply drag and drop your website project file.

However, I found simply creating a repository for your project on GitHub and connecting it to Netlify, is a far more seamless option. This way any changes to your site will update accordingly on Netlify‚Äôs end and you have various versions of your site, which you can alway revert back to.

Netlify also allows you to manage your domain, which you can easily connect using Netlify‚Äôs DNS servers. Netlify makes the process very intuitive, however, I did run into one simple issue. With a git respisotry, make sure you specify in your sites setting the build command and publish directory. Which you can find under the menu section ‚ÄúBuild & deploy.‚Äù

For build command you will input:

```noLineNumbers
gatsby build
```

For publish directory the default is:

```noLineNumbers
public
```

With all this completed your Gatsby site should be live now! Use this oppurtunity to make great content and continue experimenting! üí°
