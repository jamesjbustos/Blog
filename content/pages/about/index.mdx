Hi!

I'm James and most of my time is spent thinking about problems and solutions to those problems.

Currently an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science with a great interest in innovating and creating new technologies along with actualizing an enterprise. Regularly venturing into various projects and ideas, however, generally focused on the advent of vertical farming.
