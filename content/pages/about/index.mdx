Hi!

My name is James and most of my time is spent thinking about problems and solutions to those problems. Fortunately, technology can facilitate this process with its wide range of possibilities. However, technology does not miraculously improve, it requires radical innovation and work.

Currently an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science with great ambitions in innovating and creating new technologies along with actualizing an enterprise. Regularly venturing into various projects and ideas, however, generally focused on the advent of vertical farming.
